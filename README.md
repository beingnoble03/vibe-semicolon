# vibe 
A project made by Team </TheSemicolon> for Syntax error 2022. This is a dating app made exclusively for the IITR Junta. The backend of the project is made using Django and the frontend is made using plain Javascript and Bootstrap. 
### Features of the app
 • A lean and minimalistic interface.
 
 • Ability to edit your profile at any point of time. 
 
 • New users can upload their photographs or are assigned a unique avatar.
 
 • Profiles on the feed are arranged according to common interests and tags.
 
 • Contact details are revealed only when two users match.


 ### Note
 Due to time constraints we were only able to implement limited features. We plan to add extra features such as – 
 • Searching profiles
 
 • Set-up a date (Where date, time and venue can be sent as a request and be accepted, rejected, or modified can re-sent by the receiver).
 
 • Friends-only section- where students can look for friends sharing common interests, and not just dating partners.
